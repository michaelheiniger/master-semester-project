We are to admit no more causes of natural things than 
such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. 
Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, 
assign the same causes. - Isaac Newton
Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities 
for inferences to unknown entities. - Bertrand Russell
